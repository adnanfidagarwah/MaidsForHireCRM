MaidsforHire CRM and Job Management System
Introduction
MaidsforHire is transitioning from an operational dashboard to a comprehensive CRM and job management system. The new platform aims to seamlessly integrate lead management, communication, booking, job tracking, and client interactions into a unified interface. This system will empower the business to efficiently handle all operational and customer relationship aspects, thereby replacing reliance on external software and manual processes.
Core Modules & Features
1. Client Management
Client Profiles: Store detailed client information including name, contact details, address, and personalized notes.
Tagging System: Utilize tags like "VIP," "Recurring," or "Pet Owner" to filter clients and facilitate targeted marketing campaigns.
Interaction Timeline: Access a comprehensive history of client interactions, including calls, texts, emails, bookings, completed jobs, and payments.
2. Sales Pipeline
Visual Pipeline: Implement a Kanban-style board to manage leads and opportunities through various stages: Lead → Contacted → Proposal Sent → Booked → Won/Lost.
Automated Actions: Transitioning a lead to "Booked" generates a booking and correlates it with the job management system.
Lead Tracking: Monitor lead sources and assess estimated values for insights and reporting.
3. Bookings
Integrated Bookings: Link bookings directly to the job management module.
Detailed Booking Information: Capture specifics such as service type, date/time, assigned staff, and booking status (Pending, Confirmed, Completed, Canceled).
Rescheduling & Notifications: Allow seamless rescheduling or cancellation with automatic notifications to clients.
Calendar Integration: Provide daily, weekly, and monthly calendar views for scheduling.
4. Job Management
Automatic Job Creation: Generate jobs from bookings automatically, or create them manually as needed.
Job Status Tracking: Monitor jobs through different stages: Scheduled → In Progress → Completed.
Staff Management: Assign staff, and track payouts, deductions, supplied materials, and tips.
Post-Completion Actions: Completing a job updates the sales pipeline and triggers follow-up actions, such as review requests.
5. Messaging & Communication
Two-Way SMS: Facilitate direct text messaging within the platform.
Email Integration: Handle confirmations, reminders, and follow-up emails efficiently.
Message Tracking: Link all communication to relevant client profiles and associated bookings/jobs.

Sales and Operations Overview: Provide a clear view of sales processes and operational data.
Workflow Example
Lead Management: Leads are entered into the CRM either manually or through integration forms.
Pipeline Progression: The sales team advances leads through the stages within the pipeline.
Booking Generation: Once a lead is marked as "Booked," the system automatically creates a booking, links it to the job module, and sends a confirmation to the client.
Job Completion: Upon job completion, the system marks the opportunity as "Won" and issues a request for client feedback.
Interaction Linkage: All interactions, messages, and job history are consistently linked to the client profile for a seamless experience.
Key Goals
Systems Integration: Develop an in-house, all-encompassing CRM to replace reliance on external systems.
Streamlined Operations: Consolidate sales, communication, bookings, and operations in one cohesive platform.
Automation and Efficiency: Significantly reduce manual data entry by automating pipeline transitions, job creations, and client notifications.
Insightful Monitoring: Provide a real-time view of both sales and operations to optimize decision-making and business growth.  This new system will enable MaidsforHire to enhance customer service, optimize operational efficiency, and maintain a competitive edge in the market.
